# Readify - E-Library Dashboard

**Readify** is a web-based e-library application where users can explore and manage resources like books, articles, and other reading materials. The dashboard allows users to search for resources, view details, and manage resources such as deleting items or marking them as favorites.

This repository contains both the **frontend** (React.js) and **backend** (Node.js with Express) components of the Readify app.

## Features:
- **Dashboard View**: A central hub for users to view current and suggested resources.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for resources by title, author, or description.
- **Resource Management**: Users can delete resources they own or have access to.
- **User Profile**: User profiles can be accessed and updated.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes.

## Installation

To set up the Readify project locally, follow the instructions below.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/readify.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend

#### For Frontend (React):
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the necessary packages.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### For Backend (Node.js + Express):
Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the necessary packages.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   - This is where your React app is located.
   - The `frontend/src` folder contains your main React components.

2. **Run the frontend app**:
   - You can run the React app by executing the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   - This folder contains your Express server and the API that the React frontend communicates with.

2. **Create a `.env` file** for environment variables (such as your MongoDB URI and JWT secret):
   
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/readify
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

3. **Run the backend server**:

   To start the backend server, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Express server at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following REST API endpoints:

### 1. `GET /api/resources`
   - Fetch all resources in the system.
   
### 2. `GET /api/resources/search`
   - Search for resources based on a query string (e.g., title, author).
   - Query parameters:
     - `query`: The search term (string).

### 3. `DELETE /api/resources/:id`
   - Delete a resource by its `id`.

### 4. `POST /api/resources`
   - Add a new resource to the system. Requires authentication.

### 5. `GET /api/resources/:id`
   - Get details of a specific resource.

### Authentication:
- All routes that modify data (POST, DELETE) require JWT authentication.
- The token should be sent in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

---

## Usage

1. **Frontend**:
   - Once the frontend app is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the dashboard.
   - The app allows searching for resources, viewing resource details, and managing your resources.
   
2. **Backend**:
   - The backend server provides an API for handling resources, including CRUD operations.
   - Authentication is required for modifying resources (create, delete).
